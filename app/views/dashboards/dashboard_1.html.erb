                                    <small class="text-navy">10.01.2015</small>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Q:</strong>
                                        Have you ever heard that vaccines cause Autism?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>A:</strong>
                                        <strong> </strong>
                                        A parent’s desire to know exactly why something as serious as autism has struck her child is very strong. The fact is, science has not yet determined
                                        exactly what causes autism. But parents can be reluctant to accept a "we don’t know" answer when vaccines offer an easy and fairly plausible alternative.
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        Nevertheless, there <em>are</em> explanations.
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        The same explanation applies to vaccines and autism. Autism is usually diagnosed during the same age range when children are getting their routine shots.
                                        Naturally, if enough children develop autism during these ages, sometimes it will be noticed within a day or two after a vaccination visit. Even if it
                                        happens several hundred times, this is a tiny number compared with the millions of children who get vaccines every year and don’t develop autism afterward.
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        Also, it is a very common logical error to assume that because one event directly follows another, it must have been caused by it. We laugh at the old folk
                                        belief that the rooster’s crowing makes the sun come up, but the reasoning is exactly the same. The difference is that the idea of a rooster causing the
                                        sun to rise is ridiculous, while the idea that vaccines can cause autism sort of makes sense. But that doesn’t make the argument any more valid. For the
                                        theory that vaccines cause autism to make logical sense, someone would have to show that children who get vaccinated are more likely to develop autism than
                                        children who don’t. And no one has done that.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    It would be nice to simply say that vaccines don’t cause autism, but it wouldn’t be good science. A basic principle of science is that    <em>you can’t prove that something is not true</em>. We all believe that if you let go of an apple it will drop to the ground. But that belief is based on
                                        the observation that it has always happened that way in the past. It doesn’t <em>prove</em> that the next time you try it, the apple might not fly up into
                                        the air instead.
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        So to say that vaccines don’t cause autism would be scientifically dishonest, regardless of how sure we are that they don’t.
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        What we <em>can</em> say is that at least a dozen rigorous scientific studies — designed to detect a connection between vaccines and autism — have been
                                        published in reputable, peer-reviewed journals; and these studies have overwhelmingly <em>failed to show any connection between vaccines and autism</em>.
                                        The Institute of Medicine, an independent, objective "advisor to the nation" on health, reviewed these studies, and concluded that there is no plausible
                                        evidence that vaccines cause autism. But they went farther than that. They advised that money that could be used to fund more studies on vaccines and
                                        autism would be better spent on areas of autism research more likely to be productive.
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        This isn’t exactly saying, "Vaccines don’t cause autism," but it is about as close as any group of scientists is likely to come to it.

                                    Being a college student here at UC Merced means being faced with the responsibility to make decisions regarding your health and safety. An example of a situation that you may encounter in college is having to make decisions regarding alcohol use.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Irresponsible alcohol use can have serious consequences: 
                                    <ul>
                                    <li> More than 1800 college students die each year from alcohol related unintentional injuries </li>
                                    <li>More than 600,000 students are unintentionally injured each year while under the influence of alcohol
                                    </li>
                                    <li> Irresponsible alcohol use can also lead to sexual abuse, unsafe sex, assault, drunk driving, and academic problems.
                                    </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Abstaining from alcohol is always the safest choice to make, but if you do decide to drink, there are some things you can do to decrease your risk of alcohol-related harm:
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Avoid drinking games</li>
                                    <li>Know your limits of alcohol consumption, set your limit and keep track of your alcohol consumption </li>
                                    <li>Eat before and while you are drinking</li>
                                    <li>Always have a designated driver</li>
                                    <li>Alternate non-alcoholic drinks with those containing alcohol</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    If you think you may have a problem with alcohol please make an appointment at the Student Health Center at 209-228-2273
