                When you call to schedule an appointment for medical care, please  <b> be prepared to describe the nature of your medical issue. </b>  Our staff needs this information to give you an appropriate appointment time.
                <br><br>
                You may be transferred to speak with a nurse, informed to come in right away, or be scheduled for a same day or future appointment.
                <br><br>
                There are same day appointments available for urgent needs. Call the Student Health Center at <b> (209) 228-2273 </b> early in the day for best availability.
                <br><br> 
                Students calling later in the day may be scheduled for a future date. Advance appointments are available for routine care and physical exams.
                <br><br>
                When you are given an appointment, please report to the Health Center 10-15 minutes early.
                <br><br>
                If you are unable to keep your medical appointment, please call the Student Health Center to cancel at least 24 hours in advance.   This will allow us to serve someone else.
