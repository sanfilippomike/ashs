                For immunization review and recommendations please call Student Health Services at (209) 228-2273 to make an appointment. We reserve a portion of our appointments for same day/walk-in visits. Please bring your immunization record with you if you have not already sent it in. If you have forms that are required to fill out, please bring them to your appointment and expect a one-week turnaround time.
