                University of California Merced Student Health Services (SHS) strives to achieve the highest level of health care for our students. With that in mind, we
                would like to make our policies regarding medical treatment of patients with attention deficit disorder (ADD/ADHD) clear and available.

                                    ADHD is characterized by a number of symptoms that often begin in early childhood. Impaired concentration, problems with attention, impulsive behaviors,
                                    fidgeting and distractibility are a few of the common symptoms. It is important to have a thorough evaluation since these symptoms could be the result of other conditions or factors not related to ADHD, including other learning disabilities, emotional or medical difficulties.

                                     Treatment of ADHD with stimulant medication at SHS requires<em> documentation</em> of a professional ADHD assessment with formal    <em>psychological testing</em>. The documentation must be reviewed and approved before stimulant medication treatment can be pursued at SHS.

                                     At this time, neither SHS nor Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) provides formal ADHD diagnostic testing. Immediate community resources for ADHD
                                     testing is limited. Please contact SHS for information of testing sites in nearby communities, or testing can be done in your home community.

                                     Make an appointment with a medical provider at the student health center and bring a copy of the documentation of psychological testing and previous
                                     medications to the appointment for review. If you do not have a copy of previous testing, a release of records can be filled out at the student health center prior to the appointment date.
