                   If you are covered under another person's health plan in California - like your parent's or spouse's-your health information will not be kept private unless you take three simple steps. A confidential communication request is a request that communications be sent to the patient rather than policy holder at an alternate address or through an alternate mode of communication such as email. SB 138 requires the plans and insurers to comply with the confidential communication request in two situations: 
                   <br><br>
                   1. If the individual is requesting confidential communication regarding their receipt of sensitive services. "Sensitive services" is defined by the law to include, among other services, mental health counseling, reproductive health services, STD services, sexual assault services, and drug treatment.
                   <br><br>
                   2. If the individual states that disclosure of all or part of the information that might be revealed in an insurance communication could endanger the patient, regardless of the type of health care sought.
                   <br><br>
                   Take 3 Simple Steps: 
                   <br>
                    <span class="badge badge-primary">1.</span> Know your health plan and policy number. 
                    <br>
                    <span class="badge badge-info">2.</span> Contact your health plan.
                    <br>
