                The mission of the Health Promotion department is to provide students with the information and skills necessary to make healthy life choices, to create a campus and community environment that encourages such choices, and to connect students with appropriate resources on and off campus. The department will implement evidence-based primary prevention programs that utilize peer-to-peer education and inter-department collaboration. Such programs designed to improve student wellness will ultimately foster a more productive learning environment at UC Merced and prepare students for a healthier future after graduation.
