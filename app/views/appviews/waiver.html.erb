                    <b> If you have private insurance coverage and do not wish to be enrolled in UCSHIP for the 2015-16 academic year, you will need to submit a waiver application by the stated deadlines. Failure to submit a waiver application by the deadline will result in you remaining enrolled in UCSHIP and being responsible for the charges posted to your student account. </b>
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>
                    The Fall 2015-16 Waiver Application period opens Friday, May 1, 2015. Your Waiver Application must be filed online by 11:59 pm on Wednesday, August 12, 2015 to avoid a late waiver fee of $50. Late Waiver Applications are manually processed through the Insurance Office from Thursday, August 13, 2015 through 12 Noon on Friday, August 21, 2015 and are subject to a late fee of $50. A paper Late Waiver Application is only available at the Student Health Insurance Office after the late waiver fee is paid. 
                    <br><br>
                    Please be aware that paying the late fee does not guarantee that your late waiver will be approved. It only allows your waiver to be submitted late.
                    <br><br>
                    Absolutely no late Waivers Applications will be accepted after 12 Noon on Friday, August 21, 2015. 
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li> Once you have completed your UCSHIP waiver application, you will be immediately notified if your waiver application was approved or denied and you will be sent an email confirmation of the decision to your UC Merced email account. 
                    </li>    
                    <li> Please remember that it is the responsibility of the student to prove that a waiver application has been submitted and approved. It is recommended that you print a copy of your approval for your records. 
                    </li>
                    <li> If you submit your waiver application within 10 business days of the Registration Fee Payment deadline, you will have to pay all fees, including the UCSHIP fee, on your student account. If your waiver is approved, your student account will be refunded the full insurance fee once your waiver posts to your student account. 
                    </li>
                    <li> UC SHIP fees are charged to your student account each semester along with your registration fees. You will be required to pay these fees and will be covered by UC SHIP unless you have an approved waiver application on file with Insurance Services at the Student Health Center. 
                    </li>
                    <li> Students only have to file a waiver application once each academic year. If you have decided to waive UC SHIP, you will need to read the important information below. If you have decided to enroll in UC SHIP, you do not need to do anything. Enrollment in UC SHIP is automatic when you pay your fees. Our online waiver application is administered by Wells Fargo Insurance Services on behalf of the University.
                    </li>
                    <li> If your waiver is denied, please follow the instructions on the denial page.

                    <strong> UC Merced requires </strong> that all students have a primary care provider within 55 miles of their school address (on or off campus). Many students with Medi-Cal, or HMO insurance cannot meet this requireÂ­ment. If you cannot identify a provider within this 55 mile radius, you may not qualify to waive UCSHIP. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong> Students with an HMO: </strong> Please contact your insurance company to change your Primary Care Provider (PCP) to one in Merced.

                <p>
                    <strong> Students with Medi-Cal: </strong> you must contact your case worker and have them change to a code (024) and update only your mailing address to Merced. If they will not do this then you will need to transfer your Medi-Cal to Merced County.
